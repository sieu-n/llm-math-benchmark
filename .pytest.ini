markers =
    expensive: marks tests as expensive (deselect with '-m "not expensive"'). Especially when test actually calls openai instead of mocked version. Default is to skip these tests.
    sieun: tests that use Sieun API key.

addopts = -m "not expensive" --html=pytest-report.html --self-contained-html
